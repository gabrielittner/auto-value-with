# AutoValue: With Extension

An extension for Google's [AutoValue][auto] that implements "with-er" methods for AutoValue objects.

**Note**: This is an early version that requires the extension support currently in AutoValue 1.2-SNAPSHOT.

## Usage

Include auto-value-with in your project and "with-er" methods to your auto-value objects.

```java
@AutoValue public abstract class User {
  abstract String id();
  abstract String name();
  abstract String email();

  abstract String withEmail(String email);
}
```

The extension will generate an implementation of `withEmail(String)` that returns a new instance of `User` with the given email.
  

By convention "with-er" methods have to use with as prefix and use the exact property name for both method name and parameter name.
